MTG-LT - Magic The Gathering - Lookup Tool
=======
Abstract
-----------

This is my first time using Python libraries at any kind of level. I recently started playing "Magic the Gathering" cardgame with friends, and someone mentioned tools that exist to preform analyses on your deck compositions. While I know that such tools already exist I wanted to try my hand at making an all new one for myself and to sharpen my python knowlege. These are my results.

Please keep in mind that this is my first time using OpenCV, the MTGSDK, Git and GitHub itself, but I would Imagine that I could learn as I go along, If you're reading this feel free to critique or leave best practices and tips.

The Plan
-----------
Use image recognition to scan a card and get its database entry from the MTGSDK using the title text and narrowing by other details
